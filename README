best.m3u
========

Best genererates a playlist of your music collection based on the
top two tracks of each artist in your collection.  The top tracks
are chosen using last.fm's popularity lists.

To run
======
bestsongs.sh /path/to/music
selectsongs > best.txt
song2m3u.sh /path/to/music

To do
=====
Scripts expect music to be in directories named 'Artist - year - Album'
and files named 'track - Artist - Name'
Use last.fm's api to search for an artist in the case that a match
can't be found
XML parsing needs to be updated to work with python 2.5
